#REGINALD RECIPES FAVORITE :RICE WITH FISH

Ingredients:
        Fish fillets tilapia.
        Rice
        Vegetables (onions, bell peppers, peas)
        Garlic and ginger (optional)
        Spices and herbs (salt, pepper, paprika, thyme)
        Olive oil or butter
        Lemon or lime wedges (for garnish)

Instructions:
        Prepare the Rice:

            Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
            Cook the rice according to the package instructions or using your preferred method (boiling, steaming, rice cooker). Add salt to taste.

        Prepare the Fish:

            Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels.
            Season the fish with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices.

        Cook the Fish:

            Heat a skillet or pan over medium heat and add a small amount of olive oil or butter.
            Add the fish fillets to the pan, cooking them for a few minutes on each side until they are cooked through and easily flake with a fork.

        Prepare Vegetables:

            While the fish is cooking, you can sauté vegetables separately. In the same pan or a different one, sauté onions, bell peppers, peas, or any vegetables of your choice.
            Optionally, add minced garlic and ginger for extra flavor.
            Combine Fish and Vegetables:

        Once the fish and vegetables are cooked, combine them in the pan. Toss them together to allow the flavors to meld.

        Serve:

            Serve the fish and vegetables over a bed of rice on individual plates.
            Garnish with fresh herbs and serve with lemon or lime wedges on the side.
            Optional Sauce:

            If you like, you can prepare a simple sauce using ingredients like soy sauce, lemon juice, or a homemade vinaigrette. Drizzle the sauce over the fish and rice before serving.
            Enjoy!

        Serve your delicious rice and fish dish hot. Enjoy your meal!
